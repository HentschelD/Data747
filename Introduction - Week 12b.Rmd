## Introduction to RMarkdown and Knitr

One of the most powerful components to the R language is the ability to use packages.  These are pre-built sections of R code that students can use to assist in their tasks.  While there are hundreds of packages available for R, the course will explore some of the more popular ones found in real-world situations.  Students will also be introduced to the community of R package developers to experiment

####Sections of RMarkdown Document:

- YAML header
- Global Options 
- Basic Text (use pound sign to emphasize)
- R code (use three tick marks to signify the block)

####Assignment:

1.  Create a new RMarkdown document.
2.  Insert the R code produced for the Central Limit Theorem example.  Please make sure the ECHO is turned off for this piece of code. 
3.  Include the four graphs as part of the document.
4.  Create a R function within the document to generate basic statistics on one of the sample built-in data sets.  Please make sure the ECHO is turned on for this piece of code.  
5.  Use Knitr to generate a PDF or document file.  If necessary, install any dependent libraries in R-Studio.
6.  Create a R script that utilizes at least five functions (each) found in these packages: (Dplyr - Data Manipulation, Tidyr - Data Manipulation, Ggplot2 - Graphics)

###Turn on ECHO, load the dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 libraries
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

dplyr::summarise(iris, avg=mean(Sepal.Length))     # Summarize the mean of the Sepal Length
dplyr::count(iris,Species,wt=Sepal.Length)         # Count the species with weight on the Sepal length

abc <- tidyr::gather(iris,"Sepal.Length","Species")       # Gather columns Length and Species into rows
dplyr::glimpse(abc)                                       # Summarize that with dplyr and print it out

ggplot(mpg,aes(hwy,cty)) + geom_point(aes(color=cyl)) + scale_color_gradient()  + theme_classic()  # Perform a simple plot on the MPG data set
```

## Central Limit Theorem in RMarkdown and Knitr
Proving the central Limit Theorem using visualizations

1.  Random number between 0 and 10 executed 10,000 times.  Notice the flat top
2.  Compare that to randomly distributed means.  It looks closer to a normal distribution.
```{r random_sample, echo=FALSE}
#  Take a random number between 0 and 10 and run that 10,000 times.  Notice it has a flat top.
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(runif(10000)*10,main="",xlab="Random")

#  Compare that to randomly distributed means.  It looks closer to a normal distribution.
means <- numeric(10000)
for (i in 1:10000){
  means[i] <- mean(runif(5)*10)
}
hist(means,ylim=c(0,1600),main="",xlab = "Sample Means")
```

```
